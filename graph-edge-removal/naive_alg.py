def naive_approach(graph, gamma):
    """
    Simplifies a weighted graph by pruning edges based on their weights while maintaining connectivity.

    Parameters:
    - graph (networkx.Graph): A weighted undirected graph represented using NetworkX. 
    - gamma (float): A parameter between 0 and 1 that determines the extent of pruning. 
        A value of 0 means no edges are removed, 
        while a value of 1 results in a spanning tree.

    Returns:
    - networkx.Graph: A new graph object that is a simplified version of the input graph 

    Raises:
    - ValueError: If `gamma` is not in the range [0, 1].

    Example:
    >>> import networkx as nx
    >>> G = nx.Graph()
    >>> G.add_weighted_edges_from([(1, 2, 0.5), (2, 3, 0.2), (1, 3, 0.8)])
    >>> simplified_graph = naive_approach(G, gamma=0.5)
